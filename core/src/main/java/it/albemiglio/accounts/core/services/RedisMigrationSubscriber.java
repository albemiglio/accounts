/**
 * Subscribes to the broadcast channel on a dedicated connection and hands every received migration to
 * the {@link BroadcastMigrationService}. The subscribe call blocks its connection for life, which is
 * why it runs on its own thread with its own pooled resource.
 *
 * <p>A dropped/failed Redis connection is not fatal: the thread reconnects with bounded exponential
 * backoff and re-subscribes, running {@link BroadcastMigrationService#recoverPending()} after each
 * reconnect so migrations published during the outage are caught up. Only {@link #stop()} ends the
 * loop.
