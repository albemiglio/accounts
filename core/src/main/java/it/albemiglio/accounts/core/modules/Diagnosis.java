 * it, and in the encoding the module assumes? This is what lets an operator confirm a migration is
 * safe <em>before</em> running it — in particular {@link Status#FORMAT_MISMATCH} catches a template
 * whose {@code format} (dashed/undashed/binary) doesn't match how the plugin actually stores the uuid,
 * which a blind migration would silently miss.
